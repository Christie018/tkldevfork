Pre-release checklist
=====================

Live boot and install to hard drive
-----------------------------------

- create new VM
- check that core boots in live mode
- reboot
- check that core installs to hard drive
- reboot
- check that install to hard drive works

Confconsole
-----------

- Loads after boot, shows TKLBAM not initialized

- Network configuration works (DHCP + Static IP)
  - Set DNS to 8.8.8.8, check /etc/network/interfaces

Console sysinfo
---------------

$ ssh testcore

  TKLBAM (Backup and Migration):  NOT INITIALIZED

    system to your TurnKey Hub account. For details see the man page or
    go to:

        http://www.turnkeylinux.org/tklbam

Authentication
--------------

- log into console with root password
- log into webmin with root password
- log into webshell with root password

Service authentication
----------------------

- web app
- phpmyadmin
- phppgadmin
- others... (see confconsole services)

TKLBAM
------

- install LAMP on VirtualBox
- tklbam-init APIKEY

- test backup

  adduser alon

  echo test > /root/test
  chown alon:alon /root/test

from console cli
''''''''''''''''

# dry run

tklbam-backup --simulate

- examine /TKLBAM/fsdelta-olist
    - it should be empty (or close to it), since there is no delta!

- examine /var/lib/tklbam/profile/dirindex
    - file paths shouldn't have any weird prefix in them

# wet run

tklbam-backup

  TotalDestinationSizeChange should be about 10KB

tklbam-list

# restore from another/new installation

tklbam-restore TESTBACKUPID

  check /root/test exists and is owned by alon:alon

  examine /var/log/tklbam-restore, make sure no error messages

tklbam-rollback

    /root/test shoud be gone, as should user alon in /etc/passwd

from webmin
'''''''''''

- exercise all the functionality
- initialize tklbam

Backup
''''''

- download escrow key
- enable daily backups: yes

  check that /etc/cron.daily/tklbam-backup is +x

  enable daily backups: no

  check that /etc/cron.daily/tklbam-backup is -x

- advanced configuration:

  # check /etc/tklbam/conf to see that these changes have been applied
  change size of backup volume to 45 MBs
  change frequency of full backups to 1M

  # check /etc/tklbam/overrides to see that your changes are applied
  add override

      -/etc/.git

- Run a local simulation (/etc/.git)
- Run Backup

- do first backup (for real)

- set passphrase, then check that Passphrase field changed on the Hub

Restore
'''''''

Test restoration via Webmin from a new instance (same test conditions as
cli restore)

Should ask for passphrase because we've set one!

PHP XCache
----------

Check that the default xcache.size is large enough for that application.
32M is enough for www.turnkeylinux.org
